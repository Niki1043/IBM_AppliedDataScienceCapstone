#IBM Data Science Capstone Project

#Project Description
Create a machine learning model to predict if SpaceX will reuse the 1st Stage from launch

#Project Techonologies and Techniques
**Data Collection**
- SpaceX API request
- Webscraping from Wikipedia

**Data Wrangling**
- One-hot enocoding of categorical features

**Exploratory Data Analysis**
-SQL
-Data Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

**Interactive Visual Analytics and Dashboard**
- Folium Interactive Map
- Plotly Dash Dashboard

**Predictive Analysis (Classification)**
- Preprocess
- Standardize
- GridSearch for optimal hyperparameters and accuracy
- Evaluate classification models: 
  - Logisitic Regression
  - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
  - Decision Tree
  - K-Nearest Neighbour

#Conclusion
- Several factors determine if a rocket will land succussfully
- Interactions amongst various features impact the landing success rate
- Decision tree classifier is the optimal machine learning algorithm for predicting a 1st stage launch successful landing
